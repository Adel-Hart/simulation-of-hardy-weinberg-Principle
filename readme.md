# 1. requirement

1. python 3.11.4
2. packages
   > use the Command ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
   


# 2. take care
1. dont move graph window (make error and shut down.)

# 3. How Proceed Experiment?
1. set a gene Pool
    > Ex.   
    > AA gene Entity Amount : 400  
    >Aa(aA) gene Entity Amount : 600  
    >aa gene Entity Amount : 550
 
    > *notice*  
    >  - the more entity, the better result
2.  run simulation
3.  when each phase done, check graph and compare phase 1
4.  repeat until you want (ex. do until phase 12)
5.  click the screen while entity moves, it makes super entity that is in red circle
    > what is super entity?  
    > - 1. faster
    > - 2. bigger
    > - 3. The gene of the super entity is inherited unconditionally.
6. repeat until you want.
7. compare with phase 1

# 4. Expected result?

step 1 ~ 4 show that **the proportion of each gene pool remains nearly constant**

step 5 ~ 6 show that **the proportion of each gene pool remains nearly inconstant**

it means, when in Mendelian population, the proportion of each gene pool constant. also means not in Mendelian population(By allowing natural selection to occur), the proportion of each gene pool unconstant.
